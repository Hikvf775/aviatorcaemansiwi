## Aviator Rules

In order to play the Aviator game successfully, it is necessary to have
some knowledge of the game's rules. This will help users not lose their
money and get the most enjoyment out of the game. We invite you to
familiarise yourself with the basic rules of the Aviator game below:

-   Before starting the game, the player has to choose the amount of bet
    he is willing to make. It is possible to place two bets per round
    ranging from INR 7 to 7,000. Bets can be placed automatically;
-   The game has a multiplier that determines the player's winnings.
    This multiplier depends on how long the plane flies and can range
    from x1 to x100;
-   Once a bet has been made, you must wait for a new round -- your bet
    will come into play. During the game you're asked to keep an eye on
    the multiplier -- the player needs to leave the game when the
    multiplier is satisfying him, but it's also important to do so
    before the end of the round;
-   If he gets out before the round is over his bet will be multiplied
    by the multiplier (that was on the screen when he got out) and he
    will get the winnings;
-   If the player doesn't manage to get out of the game before the end
    of the round, the whole amount of the user's bet will be lost.
